## Gameplay

### Board
Each player has a board consisting three zones: Minion and Structure

1. Minion Zone
Summoned minions are added to the Minion Zone. Minions are destroyed if they take damage equal to their hit point total. This zone can hold an unlimited amount of minions. To save space, multiple copies of a minion can be placing a dice onto a representative card.

2. Structure Zone
The structure zone can hold up to 5 structures. Structures are destroyed if they take damage equal to their hit point total. Structures take half damage from any player spell or minion, unless stated otherwise.

### Turn
A turn consists of 3 phases: Resource, Minion, and Spell

1. Resource Phase
At the begining of the resource phase the player increases their total mana count by 2 and draws 2 cards. Then, any secondary resource effects from active spells or minions are calculated. When resolving secondary resource effects, use the state of the board at the start of the  Resource Phase (resolving order does not matter).

2. Minion Phase
During the Minion phase the player can command a number of minions equal to their Command value to attack. Minions must attack opposing minions first. If the opposing player has no minions, attacks may be directed at either the opposing player directly or the opposing player's structures.

3. Spell Phase
During the spell phase players can pay resource costs to play spells or structures any number of times.

### Win Conditions

A player loses the game when one of the following conditions is met:

1. The player loses all their hit points
2. The player must draw a card, but their deck is empty
3. The player resolves a spell or effect stating "This player loses the game."
4. The player's opponent resolves a spell or effect stating "Your opponent loses the game."
